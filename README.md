# Reflections 

I do wonder. Why on earth we are tested with coding test. AI is here and it will write better code that any human being can code. 

Instead. "tests" should measure creativeness and can do attitude and the ability to combine the abstract with the mundane. Aesthetics with logic. #lisen_me_universe
